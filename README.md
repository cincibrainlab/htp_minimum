# htp_minimum
This is the minimal version of the high throughput eeg preprocessing pipeline.  

This pipeline is developed by Dr. Ernest Pedapati and Kyle Cullion in the Cinci Brain Lab at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. 

 The High Throughput Pipeline is an in-house pipeline that also relies on eeglab, the open source processing environment developed and provided by SSCN/UCSD, to run the various stages of preprocessing.
